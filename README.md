# e-commerce

This app is an e-commerce to showcase in my portfolio 
I used react, tailwind for the design, firebase for storage
It's a basic app where you have a home page that displays all the product 
From there you can search for a product or filter by category 
You can add the product to a basket
From the baset you can empty it or update the quantity of a specific produtc
You also can delete a specific product from your basket 

What I would like to add is a user page where you can connect and access a whishlist, change your contact details, see your past purchase etc...
When you leave the basket you lose the products in it, so i will work on it so everything is send to firebase and when you connect you can retrieve your basket

It was a good project to learn to work with firebase 
For the moment it's on read only but I will work to learn to get the DB to work on read and write with the proper security
